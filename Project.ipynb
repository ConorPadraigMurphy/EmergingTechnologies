    "## What is Quantum Computing\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum computing is a cutting-edge approach to processing and storing information that uses the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics. Quantum computing uses qubits(quantum bits), whereas regular classic computers use bits e.g. 0 or 1. Qubits can exist in a superposition of states, which means that qubits can represent 0 and 1 at the same time. With this unique feature of quantum computing as well as entanglement, allows us to solve complex problems more efficiently.\n",

    "### The Fundamental Priciples of Quantum Computing\n",
    "\n",
    "With the brief introduction to the basic concept of quantum computing, we can now delve deeper into the core principles and components that enables us to harness the cutting-edge capabilities of quantum computing. Quantum computing's core principles and building blocks distinguishes it from classic computing and offers us a much greater possibility at solving complex problems more efficiently. So lets delve deeper into the key elements that allow us to harness the true potential of quantum computing.\n",

    "1. Qubits<br>\n",
    "   Qubits which is short for Quantum Bits are used as the building blocks for quantum computing. Unlike classic computing bits which can either be 0 OR 1, quantum bits have an ability called superposition, which means that a quantum bit can be 0 AND 1 at the same time. This ability allows us to open the door to process many calculations or processes at the same time. Another ability of qubits is that they can become entangled, which is another way quantum bits and classic bits differ as classic bits are unable to entangle. With the combination of both superposition and entanglement that allows quantum computers to solve complex problems more efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Superposition<br>\n",
    "   Superposition is a concept in quantum mechanics that forms the basis for the capabilities in quantum computing. It allows qubits to exist in multiple states at the same time. E.g. qubits can represent both 0 and 1 at the same time. Superposition changes how information is processed because it allows quantum computers to explore the many possible solutions to a problem. This allows quantum computations to work in parallel which can offer the completion of a certain task compared to what you could expect from a classic computer. Superposition forms the foundation of  what quantum computing offers and shows us the difference between it and classic quantum computing which is not capable at representing bits at the same time."

    "## What is Deutsch's Algorithm ?\n",
    "---\n",
    "Deutsch's Algorithm was developed in 1985 by British physicist David Deutsch. The goundbreaking algorithm showcased a new era of quantum computer problem solving by showcasing how quantum computers could outperform classic computers in completing specific tasks But what was Deutsch's algorithm created to do?, Deautsch's algorithm was created to solve a problem, The Deutsch Problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Deutsch problem, we are prsented by a black-box function (also known as oracle) where we can input a 0 or 1 as a single bit input and we will recieve a single bit out or a 0 or 1 as an output. The function will either be Constant or Balanced. Constant means that regardless of the input(whether it is 0 or 1) we can expect the same output everytime. And the Balanced Function means that the output is dependent on ther input that is revieved so that different outputs are possible for the two possible inputs, 1 and 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective behind Deutsch problem was to determine whether or not the function was constant or balanced and to do so with the fewest possible queries to the back box function. But in before deutsch's algorithm and having the worst-case scenario we would have to make at least two queries to the black box function to distinguish whether or not a specific process is balanced or constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How does Deutsch's Algorithm work?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Deutsch algorithm has a five step process.\n",
    " 1. In the forst step quantum we initalize two quantum bits.\n",
    " 2. In the second step we use the Hadamard transformation on both bits, this means each qubit has a fifty percent chance to be a 1 and a fifty percent chnace to be a 0.\n",
    " 3. The third step is where the black box function determines whether or not the outputs are constant or balanced via quantum entanglement.\n",
    " 4. The fourth step returns those bits to the measurement basis in order to find the answer.\n",
    " 5. And in the fifth and final step, the bits are mesured to obtain the solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the measurement result is a 0 then the blackbox function is constant and if the measurement is 1 this indicates that it is balanced.\n",
